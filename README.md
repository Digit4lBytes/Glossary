# 802.1X

A standard for encapsulating EAP
communications over a LAN or wireless
LAN and that provides port-based
authentication. Also known as EAP
(Extensible Authentication Protocol).

# ABAC

(attribute-based access control) An access
control technique that evaluates a set of
attributes that each subject possesses to
determine if access should be granted.

# abnormal OS process behavior

Indicators that a legitimate OS process
has been corrupted with malicious
code for the purpose of damaging or
compromising the system.

# accuracy

Property of an intelligence source that
ensures it produces effective results.

# active defense

The practice of responding to a threat by
destroying or deceiving a threat actorâ€™s
capabilities.

# active scan

An enumeration or vulnerability scan that
analyzes the responses from probes sent
to a target.

# admission control

The point at which client devices are
granted or denied access based on their
compliance with a health policy.

# adversary capability

A formal classification of the resources
and expertise available to a threat actor.

# Agile model

A software development model that
focuses on iterative and incremental
development to account for evolving
requirements and expectations.

# AI
(artificial intelligence) The science of
creating machines with the ability to
develop problem solving and analysis
strategies without significant human
direction or intervention.

# air gap

A type of network isolation that physically
separates a network from all other
networks.

# Aircrack-ng

Suite of utilities designed for wireless
network security testing.

# ALE

(annual loss expectancy) The total cost
of a risk to an organization on an annual
basis. This is determined by multiplying
the SLE by the annual rate of occurrence
(ARO).

# amplification attack

A network-based attack where the
attacker dramatically increases the
bandwidth sent to a victim during a DDoS
attack by implementing an amplification
factor. Also known as DRDoS (Distributed
Reflection Denial of Service).

# ANN

(artificial neural network) In AI, an
architecture of input, hidden, and output
layers that can perform algorithmic
analysis of a dataset to achieve outcome
objectives. Also known as neural network.

# anomaly analysis

A network monitoring system that uses
a baseline of acceptable outcomes or
event patterns to identify events that fall
outside the acceptable range. Also known
as anomaly-based detection.

# anti-tamper

Methods that make it difficult for an
attacker to alter the authorized execution
of software.

# anti-virus scanner

Software capable of detecting and
removing virus infections and (in most
cases) other types of malware, such
as worms, Trojans, rootkits, adware,
spyware, password crackers, network
mappers, DoS tools, and so on.
