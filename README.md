#802.1X

A standard for encapsulating EAP
communications over a LAN or wireless
LAN and that provides port-based
authentication. Also known as EAP
(Extensible Authentication Protocol).

#ABAC

(attribute-based access control) An access
control technique that evaluates a set of
attributes that each subject possesses to
determine if access should be granted.

#abnormal OS process behavior

Indicators that a legitimate OS process
has been corrupted with malicious
code for the purpose of damaging or
compromising the system.

#accuracy

Property of an intelligence source that
ensures it produces effective results.

#active defense

The practice of responding to a threat by
destroying or deceiving a threat actor’s
capabilities.

#active scan

An enumeration or vulnerability scan that
analyzes the responses from probes sent
to a target.

#admission control

The point at which client devices are
granted or denied access based on their
compliance with a health policy.

#adversary capability

A formal classification of the resources
and expertise available to a threat actor.

#Agile model

A software development model that
focuses on iterative and incremental
development to account for evolving
requirements and expectations.

#AI
(artificial intelligence) The science of
creating machines with the ability to
develop problem solving and analysis
strategies without significant human
direction or intervention.

#air gap

A type of network isolation that physically
separates a network from all other
networks.

#Aircrack-ng

Suite of utilities designed for wireless
network security testing.

#ALE

(annual loss expectancy) The total cost
of a risk to an organization on an annual
basis. This is determined by multiplying
the SLE by the annual rate of occurrence
(ARO).

#amplification attack

A network-based attack where the
attacker dramatically increases the
bandwidth sent to a victim during a DDoS
attack by implementing an amplification
factor. Also known as DRDoS (Distributed
Reflection Denial of Service).

#ANN

(artificial neural network) In AI, an
architecture of input, hidden, and output
layers that can perform algorithmic
analysis of a dataset to achieve outcome
objectives. Also known as neural network.

#anomaly analysis

A network monitoring system that uses
a baseline of acceptable outcomes or
event patterns to identify events that fall
outside the acceptable range. Also known
as anomaly-based detection.

#anti-tamper

Methods that make it difficult for an
attacker to alter the authorized execution
of software.

#anti-virus scanner

Software capable of detecting and
removing virus infections and (in most
cases) other types of malware, such
as worms, Trojans, rootkits, adware,
spyware, password crackers, network
