# 802.1X

A standard for encapsulating EAP
communications over a LAN or wireless
LAN and that provides port-based
authentication. Also known as EAP
(Extensible Authentication Protocol).

# ABAC

(attribute-based access control) An access
control technique that evaluates a set of
attributes that each subject possesses to
determine if access should be granted.

# abnormal OS process behavior

Indicators that a legitimate OS process
has been corrupted with malicious
code for the purpose of damaging or
compromising the system.

# accuracy

Property of an intelligence source that
ensures it produces effective results.

# active defense

The practice of responding to a threat by
destroying or deceiving a threat actor’s
capabilities.

# active scan

An enumeration or vulnerability scan that
analyzes the responses from probes sent
to a target.

# admission control

The point at which client devices are
granted or denied access based on their
compliance with a health policy.

# adversary capability

A formal classification of the resources
and expertise available to a threat actor.

# Agile model

A software development model that
focuses on iterative and incremental
development to account for evolving
requirements and expectations.

# AI
(artificial intelligence) The science of
creating machines with the ability to
develop problem solving and analysis
strategies without significant human
direction or intervention.

# air gap

A type of network isolation that physically
separates a network from all other
networks.

# Aircrack-ng

Suite of utilities designed for wireless
network security testing.

# ALE

(annual loss expectancy) The total cost
of a risk to an organization on an annual
basis. This is determined by multiplying
the SLE by the annual rate of occurrence
(ARO).

# amplification attack

A network-based attack where the
attacker dramatically increases the
bandwidth sent to a victim during a DDoS
attack by implementing an amplification
factor. Also known as DRDoS (Distributed
Reflection Denial of Service).

# ANN

(artificial neural network) In AI, an
architecture of input, hidden, and output
layers that can perform algorithmic
analysis of a dataset to achieve outcome
objectives. Also known as neural network.

# anomaly analysis

A network monitoring system that uses
a baseline of acceptable outcomes or
event patterns to identify events that fall
outside the acceptable range. Also known
as anomaly-based detection.

# anti-tamper

Methods that make it difficult for an
attacker to alter the authorized execution
of software.

# anti-virus scanner

Software capable of detecting and
removing virus infections and (in most
cases) other types of malware, such
as worms, Trojans, rootkits, adware,
spyware, password crackers, network
mappers, DoS tools, and so on.




# API
(application programming interface) A
library of programming utilities used, for
example, to enable software developers
to access functions of the TCP/IP network
stack under a particular operating system.

# APT

(advanced persistent threat) An attacker’s
ability to obtain, maintain, and diversify
access to network systems using exploits
and malware.


# Arachni

An open-source web application scanner.
arbitrary code execution
A vulnerability that allows an attacker
to run their own code or a module that
exploits such a vulnerability.


# ARO

(annual rate of occurrence) In risk
calculation, an expression of the
probability/likelihood of a risk as the
number of times per year a particular loss
is expected to occur.

# ARP poisoning

A network-based attack where an attacker
with access to the target local network
segment redirects an IP address to the
MAC address of a computer that is not
the intended recipient. This can be used
to perform a variety of attacks, including
DoS, spoofing, and Man-in-the-Middle. (On Path attack ) 
Also known as ARP spoofing.

# ASLR
(address space layout randomization)
A technique that randomizes where
components in a running application
are placed in memory to protect against
buffer overflows.

# assembly code

A compiled software program is
converted to binary machine code using
the instruction set of the CPU platform.
Assembly language is this machine code
represented in human-readable text.

# asset tagging
The practice of assigning an ID to assets
to associate them with entries in an
inventory database.

# ATT&CK
(Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and
Common Knowledge) A knowledge base
maintained by the MITRE Corporation for
listing and explaining specific adversary
tactics, techniques, and procedures.

# attack surface

The points at which a network or
application receives external connections
or inputs/outputs that are potential
vectors to be exploited by a threat actor.

# attack vector
A specific path by which a threat actor
gains unauthorized access to a system.

# AUP
(acceptable use policy) A policy that
governs employees’ use of company
equipment and Internet services. ISPs
may also apply AUPs to their customers.
Also known as a fair use policy.

# Autopsy
The Sleuth Kit is an open source collection
of command line and programming
libraries for disk imaging and file analysis.
Autopsy is a graphical frontend for
these tools and also provides a case
management/workflow tool.

# AutoRuns
Tool in the Microsoft Sysinternals suite to
identify processes run at startup.

# awk
A scripting engine optimized for string
search and filtering.
